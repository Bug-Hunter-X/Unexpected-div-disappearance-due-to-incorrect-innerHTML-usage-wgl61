# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Div Disappearance

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the misuse of `innerHTML`. The code intends to hide some text within a div, but due to an incorrect approach using `innerHTML`, the entire div disappears unexpectedly.

## Bug Description
The issue arises from attempting to manipulate CSS styles indirectly through `innerHTML`. Modifying the innerHTML of a parent element replaces its content entirely, potentially removing any existing style declarations applied to child elements. 

## Solution
The solution involves using the correct methods for modifying CSS styles or element visibility. Direct style manipulation or the use of CSS classes is recommended.
